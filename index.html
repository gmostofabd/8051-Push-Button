		  <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <blockquote>
		  <p>
            A very simple and easy way to provide for human interaction with the microcontroller 
            is to insert a button into the circuit. We communicate with computers using two main 
            input devices: the mouse and the keyboard. A keyboard is nothing more than a bunch of 
            buttons. Adding a button or switch to the circuit enables the microcontroller to 
            receive human input.<br><br>
    
            In the first experiment, we’ve focused on output only. Now we’re going to go to the 
            other end of spectrum and play around with inputs. Push button switches are widely 
            used in embedded system seen in very simple to highly complex systems. So, knowledge 
            about  interfacing them to  any microcontroller is very essential in designing such 
            systems. This lesson deals with the technicalities of push button interfacing with 
            8051 microcontroller and includes a simple example of microcontrollers digital Read
            function and then so as to ON and OFF an LED.

      <h3>Hardware Discussion: Push Buttons</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
          A <strong>push-button</strong> (also spelled pushbutton) or simply button or tactile 
          switch is a component that connects two points in a circuit when you press it. Buttons 
          are typically made out of hard materials and its surface is usually flat or shaped to 
          accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed.
        </p>

      <h3>Push Button Features :</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Two state mechanism. Initially, it remains in off state or normally</li>
          <li><strong>open</strong> state but when it is pressed, we can say it <strong>close</strong> state.</li>
          <li>Available Momentary and Latching types</li>
          <li>Available size, color, shape etc.</li>
          <li>Available in Vertical and Horizontal pin outs.</li>
          <li>High Durability</li>
          <li>Click response high.</li>
      </ul>

        <blockquote>
        <p>
            A typical push button switch has two active terminals that may be normally open 
            or closed and changes its state when pressed or depressed. Sometimes we get 4 pins 
            with push buttons having a paired (internally connected) terminals of each pin which 
            is illustrated in the following figure. There are also some push buttons are normally 
            closed but open when is pressed. Those are used for some special purposes.

        <h3>How it works?</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            If we connect the push button switch directly to a Microcontroller to get digital input, 
            It means switch one pin is connected to Ground or 5v Vcc and another pin connected to 2
            Microcontroller digital pin. In this case, the Microcontroller is read unstable input 
            from the push button.
            <br><br>So, we need to connect a “pull-up” or “pull-down” resistors circuit to stabilizes 
            the input, when using the switch.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Pull-up Resistors :</strong>
            If the push button one pin is connected to the Vcc through a resistor 
            and the other pin is connected to the ground, this circuit known as the pull-up resistor 
            circuit. In this case, the push button output is High(1) when the button is open, and the 
            output of the push button is Low(0) when the button is pressed.

            <br><br><strong>Pull-down Resistors :</strong>
            If the push button one pin is connected to the ground through a resistor and the other 
            pin is connected to the Vcc, this circuit known as the pull-down resistor circuit. In this 
            case, the push button output is Low(0) when the button is open, and the output of the push 
            button is High(1) when the button is pressed.

        <blockquote>
        <p>
            A push button switch is connected to PORT-0 PIN-0. The SW is connected externally 
            with a pull-up resistor since there is no internal pull-up resistor for port 0. 
            The other end of the push button is connected to ground.

            <br><br>The voltages at the pins will be VCC (Approx) when the button is not pushed. 
            The input pin will get grounded on pressing the button. The LED connected to the 
            PORT-2 PIN-0 with a series resistor to limit the current. Our target is to ON the 
            LED as long as the Button (ON) is pressed and hold and vice versa.

        <h3>Post Run Discussion : Button Read Using Interrupt</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            Let's start with a simple example - using an Interrupt to monitor a button press. 
            To start, we'll take a sketch you've likely seen before - the "Button" example 
            sketch included above in this article. This time, to read the button using an 
            external interrupt source we will connect the switch to the INT0 pin at P3.2

          <br><br>An <strong>ISR</strong> is just like any other subroutine we write inside a 
          program, except for the difference that an ISR must always end with a 
          <strong>RETI</strong> instruction and not with a <strong>RET</strong> instruction 
          (as in the case of subroutines). An ISR when evoked, executes a certain lines 
          of code that does some kind of operations. It can be anything as defined by 
          the programmer. The only condition is that the first line of ISR must begin 
          from the corresponding vector address. Vector address of INT0 is 0003H and that 
          of INT1 is 0013H for the 8051 Microcontrollers.
