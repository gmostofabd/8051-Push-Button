        <blockquote>
            <p>
                A Seven Segment Display (SSD) is a form of electronic display 
                device for displayingdecimal numerals 0 to 9 and few characters 
                like A, b, C, c, H, h, L etc. These arethe oldest yet one of 
                the efficient types of display used in embedded applications.
                Seven-segment displays are widely used in digital clocks, 
                electronic meters, basiccalculators, and other electronic 
                devices that display numerical information.
                
                
                <br><br>This article is about how to interface a seven segment 
                LED display to any mi-crocontroller. Funny thing is that if you 
                want to control a single digit 7 segmentdisplay, then it is 
                nothing but controlling 7 LED’s as we learnt from the previous 
                experiment. For multiple segments, there are simple studies for 
                hardware and soft-ware as well. However a good Knowledge about 
                how to interface a seven segmentdisplay to a microcontroller 
                is very essential in designing embedded systems.

                A seven segment display consists of seven LEDs arranged in the form 
                of a squarish‘8’ slightly inclined to the right and a single LED as 
                the dot character. Differentcharacters can be displayed by 
                selectively glowing the required LED segments.
    
                <br><br>The displays common pin is generally used to identify which 
                type of 7-segmentdisplay it is. As each LED has two connecting pins, 
                one called the “Anode” andthe other called the “Cathode”, there are 
                therefore two types of 7-segment displaycalled: Common Cathode7(CC) 
                and Common Anode8(CA).

            A CC SSD circuit activity has shown at left of above figure. We can 
            see that only two switches (b and c) are closed and all other 
            switches are open. So, we can produce the binary data pattern as 
            00000110 which is equivalent to 03H. And we are getting the decimal 
            value 1 is illuminated on the display. And Now we can have all the 
            required data patterns for displaying 0 to 9 using the same method 
            as in the table of above figure.

        The circuit diagram shown above is of an AT89S51 microcontroller based 0 
        to 9 counter which has a 7 segment LED display interfaced to it in order 
        to display the count.  This simple circuit illustrates two things. How 
        to setup simple 0 to 9 up counter using 8051 and more importantly how 
        to interface a seven segment LED display to  8051 in order to display 
        a particular result. The common cathode seven segment display D1 is 
        connected to the Port 1 of the microcontroller (AT89S51) as shown in the 
        circuit diagram. R3 to R10 are current limiting resistors. S3 is the 
        reset switch and R2,C3 forms a debouncing circuitry. C1, C2 and X1 are 
        related to the clock circuit. The software part of the project has to do 
        the following tasks.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Suppose you need a three digit display connected to the 8051. Each 7 
                segment display have 8 pins and so a total amount of 24 pins are to 
                the connected to the microcontroller and there will be only 8 pins 
                left with the microcontroller for other input output applications. 
                Also the maximum number of displays that can be connected to the 8051 
                is limited to 4 because 8051 has only 4 ports. More over three 3 
                displays will be ON always and this consumes a considerable amount of 
                power. All these problems associated with the straight forward method 
                can be solved by  multiplexing .

            <p>In multiplexing all displays are connected in parallel to one port 
                and only one display is allowed to turn ON at a time, for a short 
                period. This cycle is repeated for at a fast rate and due to the 
                persistence of vision of human eye, all digits seems to glow. The 
                main advantages of this method are

            <p>
                When assembled and powered on, the circuit will display the number
                ’16’ and let us see how it is done. Initially the first display is 
                activated by making  P3.0 high and then digit drive pattern for “1” 
                is loaded to  the Port 1. This will make the first display to show 
                “1”. In the mean time P3.1 will be low and so do the second display 
                will be OFF. This condition is maintained for around 1ms and then 
                P3.0 is made low. Now both displays will be OFF. Then the second 
                display is activated by making P3.1 high and then the digit drive 
                pattern for “6” is loaded to the port 1. This will make the second 
                display to show “6”. In the mean time P3.0 will be low and so the 
                second display will be OFF.  This condition is maintained for 
                another 1ms and then port 3.1 is made low. This cycle is repeated 
                and due to the persistence of vision you will feel it as “16”.
    
                <br><br>Transistor Q1 drives the first display (D1) and transistor 
                Q2 drives the second display (D2). R11 and R12 are the base current 
                limiting resistors of Q1 and Q2. The purpose of other components 
                are explained in the first circuit.
